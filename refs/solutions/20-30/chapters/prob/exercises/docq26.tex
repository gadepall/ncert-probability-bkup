Let $X_k \in \cbrak{-1,0,3,6,r}, k = 1,2, \dots$ represent the described process, where $r,3,6$ denote the outcome of the die and -1,0 denote the outcome of the coin, 0 representing a tail.  In general, the transition probabilities for the Markov Chain are
\begin{align}
\pr{X_n = 0|X_{n-1} = r} &=\pr{X_n = -1|X_{n-1} = r} 
\\
&= \frac{1}{2}
\\
\pr{X_n = 0|X_{n-1} = 3} &=\pr{X_n = -1|X_{n-1} = 3} 
\\
&=0
\\
\pr{X_n = 0|X_{n-1} = 6} &=\pr{X_n = -1|X_{n-1} = 6} 
\\
&=0
\\
\pr{X_n = 3|X_{n-1} = r} &= 0
\\
\pr{X_n = 6|X_{n-1} = r} &= 0
\\
\pr{X_n = r|X_{n-1} = r} &= 0
\\
\pr{X_n = 3|X_{n-1} = 6} &= 
\pr{X_n = 6|X_{n-1} = 3} 
\\
\pr{X_n = 3|X_{n-1} = 3} &= 
\pr{X_n = 6|X_{n-1} = 6} 
\\
&= \frac{1}{6}
\\
\pr{X_n = r|X_{n-1} = 3} &= 
\pr{X_n = r|X_{n-1} = 6} 
\\
= \frac{4}{6}
\end{align}
Thus,
\begin{align}
\pr{X_2 = 0|X_1 = 3} = 0
\end{align}
