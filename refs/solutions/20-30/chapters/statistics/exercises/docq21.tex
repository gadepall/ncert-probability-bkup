	\item  100 surnames were picked randomly from a telephone directory and the frequency distribution of the number of letters in english alphabet in surnames were obtained as follows.Determine the median number of letters in the surname and also find the modal size of the surnames. Also find the mean.\\
	
		\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{center}
    	\input{./tables/statistics/exercises/stat_ex_q21_que.tex}
	\caption{Frequency distribution of the number of letters in surname}
	\label{table:table10}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	
	
	\solution  The following python code computes the mean, median and mode.
	\begin{lstlisting}
	codes/statistics/exercises/q21.py
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\begin{align}
	\text{Median} &= l + \frac{\frac{n}{2} -cf}{f}\times h
	\end{align}
	\begin{align}
	\text{n} = \sum f_{i} = 100 \implies \frac{n}{2} = 50\\
	\end{align}
	$\therefore$ 7-10 is the median class.\\
	Here l is the lower limit of the median class = 7\\
	h is the classinterval =3\\
	cf is the cumulative frequency of the class before median class = 36\\
	f is the frequency of the median class



	\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{center}
    	\input{./tables/statistics/exercises/stat_ex_q21_ans.tex}
	\caption{Frequency distribution of the number of letters in surname}
	\label{table:table10}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}
	\begin{align}
	\text{Mean} &= \frac{\sum f_ix_i}{\sum f_i}\\
	\text{Mean} &= \frac{832}{100}\\
	\text{Mean} &= 8.32
	\end{align}

	\begin{align}
	\text{Median} &= 7 + \frac{50 - 36}{40}\times 3\\
	\text{Median} &= 7 + 1.05 = 8.05
	\end{align}
	Hence median no. of letters is 8.05
	\begin{align}
	\text{Mode} &= l + \frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1 - f_0 - f_2} \times h
	\end{align}
	Modal class is the interval with the highest frequency = 7-10, where\\
	l is lower limit of the modal class = 7\\
	h is the class interval = 4-1=3\\
	$f_1$ is the frequency of the modal class = 40\\
	$f_0$ is frequency of the class before modal class = 30\\
	$f_2$ is frequency of the class after modal class = 16\\
	\begin{align}
	\text{Mode} &= 7 + \frac{40-30}{80-30-16} \times 3
	\end{align}	
	which is calculated as 7.88
	
\end{enumerate}
