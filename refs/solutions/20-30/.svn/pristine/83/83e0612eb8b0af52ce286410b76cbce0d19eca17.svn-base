\item Given three identical boxes I, II and III, each containing two coins. In box I, both coins are gold coins, in box II, both are silver coins and in the box III, there is one gold and one silver
coin. A person chooses a box at random and takes out a coin. If the coin is of gold, what is the probability that the other coin in the box is also of gold?
\\\solution Let $B_1,B_2,B_3$ denote the events of selecting box 1,box 2, box 3 respectively.\\
We need to find the probability that the other coin in the box is also gold if the $1^{st}$ coin is also gold.\\
Let G denote the event of '$2^{nd}$ coin is gold'.\\


\begin{align}
P\brak{\frac{B_1}{G}} = \frac{P\brak{B_1}.P\brak{\frac{G}{B_1}}}{P\brak{B_1}.P\brak{\frac{G}{B_1}} + P\brak{B_2}.P\brak{\frac{G}{B_2}} + P\brak{B_3}.P\brak{\frac{G}{B_3}}} 
\end{align}
\begin{align}
P\brak{\frac{B_1}{G}} &= \frac{\frac{1}{3}.1}{\frac{1}{3}.1 + \frac{1}{3}.0 + \frac{1}{3}.\frac{1}{2}}
\end{align}
which is calculated to be 0.66
