Let $X \in \cbrak{0,1}$ where 0 represents black.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Probability of picking a black ball 
\begin{align}
\pr{X=0}= \frac{10}{18} = \frac{5}{9}
\end{align}
\item Probability of picking a red ball 
\begin{align}
\pr{X=1} = 1-\pr{X=0}=  \frac{4}{9}
\end{align}
\item Two balls are drawn with replacement. So each event is independent of each other. 
 Probability that both balls are red 
\begin{align}
\pr{X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1} &= \brak{\frac{4}{9}}^2
\\
&=\frac{16}{81}
\end{align}
\item Probability that first ball is black and second is red
\begin{align}
\pr{X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1}&= \frac{5}{9}\times\frac{4}{9}\\
&= \frac{20}{81}
\end{align}
\item Probability that one ball is black and other is red 
\begin{multline}
\pr{X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1}+\pr{X_1 = 1, X_2 = 0}
\\
= \frac{16}{81}+\frac{20}{81}= \frac{4}{9}
\end{multline}
