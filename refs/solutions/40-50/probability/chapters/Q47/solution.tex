Let $X \in {0,1}$ where 0 represents black.  Let $X_1$ represent the event representing drawing the first ball. $X_2$ represent the event of drawing the second ball.
Then  probability of the second ball being red is
\begin{multline}
\pr{X_2 = 1} 
\\
= \pr{X_2 = 1,X_1 = 1}+\pr{X_2 = 1,X_1 = 0}
\\
=\pr{X_2 = 1|X_1 = 1}\pr{X_1 = 1}
\\
+\pr{X_2 = 1|X_1 = 0}\pr{X_1 = 0}
\end{multline}
From the given information,
\begin{align}
\pr{X_1 = 0} = \pr{X_1 = 1}
=\frac{5}{10}=\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align}
Also, 
\begin{align}
\pr{X_2 = 1|X_1 = 0} &= \frac{5}{5+2+7} = \frac{5}{12}
\\
\pr{X_2 = 1|X_1 = 1} &= \frac{5+2}{5+2+5} = \frac{7}{12}
\end{align}
Thus, 
\begin{multline}
\pr{X_2 = 1} = \frac{7}{12}\times \frac{1}{2} 
\\
+ \frac{5}{12}\times \frac{1}{2}
=\frac{1}{2}
\end{multline}
