Let $X \in \cbrak{0,1}$ represent the male and female fish respectively.  Then
the desired probability is
\begin{align}
\pr{X=0} = \frac{5}{5+8}=\frac{5}{13}
\end{align}
The python code for the distribution is
\begin{lstlisting}
solutions/20-10/prob/codes/fish.py
\end{lstlisting}
The code checks how many times a male fish is picked out of the total times (taken as 100,000 in the given code) a fish is picked up from the tank with replacement.
