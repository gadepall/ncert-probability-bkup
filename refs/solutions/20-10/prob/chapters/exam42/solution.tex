Let X be the random variable representing the number of defective eggs from the ten eggs picked. X follows a  binomial distribution.  Since the probability of an egg being defective is 10\%, substituting n=10, p= 0.1 and k=0 in equation \eqref{eq:exam41_1}, 
probability that there is atleast one defective egg is 
\begin{align}
\pr{X \geq 1}&= 1 - \pr{X=0}  = 1-\brak{0.9}^{10}
\\
&=0.6513215599
\end{align}
