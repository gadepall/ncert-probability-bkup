Let $X \in \cbrak{0,1}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The probability of drawing a defective bulb is 
\begin{align}
\pr{X=0} = \frac{4}{20}= \frac{1}{5}
\end{align}
\item After drawing a non defective bulb,
The probability of drawing a non-defective bulb is 
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 1}= \frac{15}{19}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
