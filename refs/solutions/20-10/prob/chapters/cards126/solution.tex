\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The probability that a queen is picked is 
\begin{align}
\pr{Z = 10|Z \in \cbrak{10,11,12,13,14}} = \frac{1}{5}
\end{align}
\item After a queen is drawn and put aside
The probability that an ace is picked is 
\begin{align}
\pr{Z = 14|Z \in {10,11,13,14}}= \frac{1}{4}
\end{align}

The probability that a queen is picked from the remaining cards is 
\begin{align}
\pr{Z=12|Z \in {10,11,13,14}} = 0
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
The python code below calculates the above probabilities for 100000 picks
