Let the sample space be $X \in \cbrak{0,1}$.  From the given information, the probability of hitting a boundary is
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 1}
 &= \frac{6}{30}
\\
&= \frac{1}{5}
\end{align}
%
Hence, the probability of not hitting the boundary is
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 0} = 
1 - \pr{X = 1} &= 1-\frac{1}{5}
\\
&= \frac{4}{5}
\end{align}
