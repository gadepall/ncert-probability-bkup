Say there are 100 people. Half of them men and half of them women. 5\% of men have grey hair(2.5 men) and 0.25\% of women have grey hair(0.125 women)


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| } 
\hline
 & \textbf{Men} & \textbf{Women} & \textbf{Total} \\
\hline
 & 50 & 50 & 100 \\ 
\hline
\textbf{Greyhair} & 2.5 & 0.125 & \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


 Required probability = how many of men have grey hair = $\frac{\textbf{Men with grey hair}}{\textbf{total grey haired persons}} \\ = \frac{2.5}{2.5+0.125} \\ = \frac{2.5}{2.625} \\ = \textbf{0.95238} $ 
 
\textbf{ Another way using Bayes theorem}:

M - No of men, W = No of women , G = No of grey persons
$P(M) = 0.5 = P(W) \\ P(G|M) =0.05 \\ P(G|W) = 0.0025 \\ P(M|G) \textbf{ is what we need to find } $

\textbf{By bayes theorem}, 
\begin{multline*}
%\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
P(M|G) & = \frac{P(M,G)}{P(G)} \\
 & = \frac{P(G|M)P(M)}{P(G)} \\
 & = \frac{P(G|M)P(M)}{P(G|M)P(M)+P(G|W)P(W)} \\
 & = \frac{0.05*0.5}{0.05*0.5+0.0025*0.5} \\
 & = \frac{0.025}{0.02625} \\
 & = \textbf{0.95238}
\end{split}
%\end{equation}
\end{multline*}
