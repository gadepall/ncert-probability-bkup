There are 6 outcomes when we throw a die, which are independent of one another. The probability of getting 5 on the die 
\begin{align}
    p = \frac{1}{6}
\end{align}
The die is thrown 7 times and are not dependent on one another \begin{align}
    n = 7
\end{align}
Let the Random Variable be $X$ denote the number of 5s in 7 throws
By Binomial Distribution, we have
\begin{align}
    \Pr(X=k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{align}
We should get 5 exactly twice, so $ k = 2 $\\

The probability of getting 5 exactly twice in 7 throws of a die is given by 
\begin{align}
    \Pr(X=2) &= \comb{^7}{C}{_2}\brak{\frac{1}{6}}^2 \brak{\frac{5}{6}}^5 \\[7pt]
    \Pr(X=2) &= 0.234428
