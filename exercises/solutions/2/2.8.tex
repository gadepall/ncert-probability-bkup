let $M \in \{0,1\}$ be a random variable such that $M=0$ represents product is not introduced by winning group and $M=1$ represents product is introduced by the winning group.let $H \in \{0,1\}$ be another random variable such that $H=0$ represents that group A wins,$H=1$ represents that group B wins.

$M = 0$  &not introduced by winning group \\

$M = 1$  &introduced by winning group \\

$H = 1$  & group B wins \\

we know that Bayes theorem:
\begin{align}
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} ,ifP(B)\neq 0.
\end{align}
so required probability that new product was introduced by group B be P.
\begin{align}
 P=Pr(M=0|H=0)+Pr(M=1|H=1)\\
 =0.18+0.12 \\ 
 =0.30\\
\end{align}
hence the required probability that the product was introduced by the second group is 0.30
