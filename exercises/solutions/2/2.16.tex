Let X be a random variable taking two values 0 and 1(Bernoulli random variable).
\\X=1 iff first ball is white and X=0 iff first ball is red.\\
\\Let Y be another random variable taking two values 0 and 1(Bernoulli random variable). \\
\\Y=1 iff second ball is white and Y=0 iff second ball is red.\\
\\We are required to find the conditional probability of secondball being red given first ball removed is white.\\
\\The probability of taking first ball as black will be,
\begin{align}
\pr(X=1)=\frac{4}{7}
\end{align}
The probability of taking second ball as given first ball taken was white will be %--conditional probability--% 
\pr(Y=0|X=1) %-- nothing but probability of taking a red ball from a box containing 3 white balls and 3 red balls--%
By the definition of conditional probability,
\begin{align}
\pr(Y=0| X=1)=\frac{n(Y=1)}{6}
\end{align}
here n(Y=1)=3.
from equations (2.0.1),(2.0.2).
\begin{align}
\pr(Y=0|X=1)=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{align}
Hence,the required probability is 0.5
