Consider two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$. We say that $X$ and $Y$ are independent if
\begin{align}
Pr(X=x, Y=y)= Pr(X=x)P(Y=y) 
\end{align}
for all $x, y$\\
A die is thrown.
We know that the sample space is
\begin{align}
\mathbf{S} = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
\end{align}
Let two events be\\
E : the number appear is a multiple of 3 .\\
F : the number appearing is even.
\begin{align}
\mathrm{E}:(3,6) \& \mathrm{F}:(2,4,6)
\end{align}
Bernoulli random variables Say $X_1$ and $X_2$
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ | m{2cm} | m{15em}| } 
\hline
$Pr(X_1=1)$& will refer to probability that event E occurs\\ 
\hline
 $Pr(X_1=0)$&  will refer to probability that event E not occurs \\ 
\hline
$Pr(X_2=1)$ &  will refer to probability that event F occurs \\ 
\hline
$Pr(X_2=0)$ &  will refer to probability that event F not occurs  \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table for Bernoulli random variables.}
\label{tab:truthTables}   
\end{table}
\begin{align}
Pr(X_1=1,X_2=1) = Pr(A\in\{6\}) = \frac{1}{6}\\
Pr(X_1=1) = Pr(A\in\{3,6\}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\\
Pr(X_2=1) = Pr(A\in\{2,4,6\}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\\
Pr(X_1=1)Pr(X_2=1) = \frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
\end{align}
From above Equations, we get
\begin{align}
Pr(X_1=1, X_2=1) = Pr(X_1=1)Pr(X_2=1)
\end{align}
Therefore Event $E$ and $F$ are independent events.
