Given A and B are Independent events and 
\begin{align}
\pr{A} = 0.3 \\
\pr{B} = 0.4
\end{align}
\begin{enumerate}
\item By definition,
\begin{align}
\pr{AB} = \pr{A}\pr{B} \\
\pr{AB} = (0.3)(0.4) \\
\therefore \pr{AB} = 0.12 \label{6.12:eq:1}
\end{align}
\item By definition,
\begin{align}
\pr{A + B} = \pr{A} + \pr{B} - \pr{AB}
\end{align}
From \eqref{6.12:eq:1}, 
\begin{align}
\pr{A + B} = 0.3 + 0.4 - (0.12) \\
\therefore \pr{A + B} = 0.58
\end{align}
\item From the definition of Independent Events,
\begin{align}
\pr{A/B} = \pr{A} \\
\therefore \pr{A/B} = 0.3 
\end{align}
\item From the definition of Independent Events,
\begin{align}
\pr{B/A} = \pr{B} \\
\therefore \pr{B/A} = 0.4
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
