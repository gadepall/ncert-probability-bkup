\item In the given question,
\\
The sample size = Possible number of tosses=4
\begin{align}
\myvec{\bmat{HH}&\bmat{TT}&\bmat{HT}&\bmat{TH}}
\end{align}
Favourable outcome =Either one of them=1
\\
Probability of happening of either one of the event is given by
\begin{align}
P=\frac{1}{4}
\end{align}
$\therefore$ The argument given is incorrect, as the sample size being 4.

which shows the comparision between theory and simulation.
