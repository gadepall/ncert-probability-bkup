Which of the following arguments are correct and which are not correct? Give reasons
for your answer.\\
(i) If two coins are tossed simultaneously there are three possible outcomes—two
heads, two tails or one of each. Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the
probability is $\frac{1}{3}$ \\
(ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes—an odd number or an even
number. Therefore, the probability of getting an odd number is $\frac{1}{2}$
