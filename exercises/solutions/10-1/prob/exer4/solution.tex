Let $X_i\in \cbrak{0,1}, i = 1, 2, 3$ represent a coin toss, or, the Bernoulli random variable.  Then the outcome of the game is
\begin{align}
X = X_1+X_2+X_3	
\end{align}
If 
\begin{align}
\pr{X_i = 1} &= p,
\\
\pr{X = k} &= \comb{n}{k}p^k\brak{1-p}^k, \quad k = 0,\dots, n
\end{align}
$X$ is known as a Binomial random variable.  For the given problem, $n = 3, p = \frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of a win is 
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 3} + \pr{X = 0} &= \frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}
\\
&= \frac{1}{4}
\end{align}
The loss probability is then
\begin{align}
1-\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\end{align}
