(i)Complete the following table:
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Event:'Sum on two dice'&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12\\
\hline
Probability&$\frac{1}{36}$ &-&-&-&-&-& $\frac{5}{36}$ &-&-&-& $\frac{1}{36}$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}\\
(ii) A student argues that â€˜there are 11 possible outcomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.Therefore,each of them has a probability $\frac{1}{11}$ Do you agree with this argument? Justify your answer.
