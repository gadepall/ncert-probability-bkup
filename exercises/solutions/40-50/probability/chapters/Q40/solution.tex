$X_i \in \cbrak{0,1}$, where 0 represents an even number. 
The 3 trials are represented by
\begin{align}
X = X_1+X_2+X_3
\end{align}
Then $X \sim B\brak{3,\frac{1}{2}}$
The probability of getting only an even number is
\begin{align}
\pr{X=0} = \comb{n}{0}\brak{\frac{1}{2}}^3
\end{align}
Thus, the probability of getting at least one odd number is 
\begin{align}
1- \pr{X=0}&=1 - \frac{1}{8}
\\
&= \frac{7}{8}
\end{align}
