Let $X \in \cbrak{0,1}$ where 0 represents Hindi.  From the given information,
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 0} &= \frac{60}{100} = \frac{3}{5}
\\
\pr{X = 1} &= \frac{40}{100} = \frac{2}{5}
\\
\pr{X = 0, X=1} &= \frac{20}{100} = \frac{1}{5}
\end{align}
Note that the events are dependent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Probability that the student reads neither Hindi nor English
\begin{multline}
\pr{X \ne 0, X \ne 1} = 1 
\\
- \lsbrak{\pr{X=0}+\pr{X=1}}
\\
-\rsbrak{\pr{X=0,X=1}}
= \frac{1}{5}
\end{multline}
\item Probability that she reads English newspaper if it is known that she reads Hindi newspaper
\begin{align}
\pr{X=1|X=0} &= \frac{\pr{X=1,X=0}}{\pr{X=0}}
\\
&= \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{3}{5}}
= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
\item Probability that she reads Hindi newspaper if it is known that she reads English newspaper
\begin{align}
\pr{X=0|X=1} &= \frac{\pr{X=1,X=0}}{\pr{X=1}}
\\
&= \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{2}{5}} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
