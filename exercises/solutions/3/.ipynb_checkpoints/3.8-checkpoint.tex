Properties to be satisfied if a trial needs to be a bernoulli trial:\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Number of trials should be finite.
    \item each trial should have utcomes of success and failure.\
    \item if P is the success probability then failure probability should be 1-P
    \item probability of success should not vary with trial
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Case(i):Replaced} \\ 
Number of red balls = 7\\
Number of black balls = 9\\
let X be the random variable and 
\begin{itemize}
    \item X=1 is success which is Drawing red ball
    \item X=0 is Failure which is Drawing black ball
\end{itemize}
Success Probability 
\begin{equation}
    P(X=1) = \frac{7}{16} 
\end{equation}
Failure Probability
\begin{equation}
     P(X=0) = \frac{9}{16} = 1-P(X=1)
\end{equation}
 Success Probability is  constant for all Trials.
 as X satisfies all properties of Bernoulli therefore Trials are Bernoulli Trials.\\ \\
\textbf{Case(ii):Not Replaced} \\ \\
In this case Success Probability is 
\begin{equation}
    P(X=1) =\frac{7}{16}
\end{equation}
 for Second Trial 
\begin{equation}
     P(X=1) = \frac{6}{15} 
\end{equation} 
 Corresponding Failure Probabilities are 
 \begin{equation}
     P(X=0) = \frac{9}{16}
 \end{equation} and for 2nd trial 
 \begin{equation}
     P(X=0) = \frac{8}{15}
 \end{equation}  
  probability of success and corresponding failure is varying with trials therefore these are not Bernoulli Trials. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Case(i):Trials are Bernoulli Trials 
    \item Case(ii): Trials are not Bernoulli Trials
\end{itemize}
