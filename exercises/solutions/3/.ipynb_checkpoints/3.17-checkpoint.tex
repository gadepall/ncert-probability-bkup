For the 3rd six to occur in the 6th trial, 2 sixes should compulsorily occur in 5 trials.  Defining $X \sim B\brak{5,\frac{1}{6}}$, this probability is given by
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 2} = \comb{5}{2}\brak{\frac{1}{6}}^2\brak{\frac{5}{6}}^3
\end{align}
%
The desired probability is then obtained as
\begin{align}
    \pr{X=2}\times\frac{1}{6} = \frac{625}{23328} 
\end{align}
