\begin{enumerate}
\item 
From the given information, 
\begin{align}
\pr{46<X<50} &= \frac{3}{38}
\\
&= 0.079
\end{align}

\item There is no student whose weight is less than 31 kg thus the probability of a student to have the weight less than 31 kg = 0\\

All of the student in this context  have the weight between 31-75 so we can say that the probability of the students to have the weight in the range 31-75 = 1
\end{enumerate}
