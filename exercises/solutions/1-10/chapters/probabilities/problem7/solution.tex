\begin{enumerate}
\item total no of people working at the work place = 40
no of people live less than 7km from the work place = 9
let probability of a emgineer livinf less than 7 km from workplace = P(A)
\begin{align}
P\left(A\right)&=\frac{9}{40}
\end{align}
\item no of people live more  than or equal 7km from the work place = 31
let probability of a emgineer livinf less than 7 km from workplace = P(B)
\begin{align}
P\left(B\right)&=\frac{31}{40}
\end{align}
\item there is no one who live within $\frac{1}{2}$ km from the work place so the probability will be 0.
