Let $X \in \cbrak{0,1,2,3}$ be the card type, $Y \in{0,1}$ be the colour and 
$\vec{Z} \in \cbrak{0,1,\dots,12}$ be the card number.
The sample size = total number of cards ina deck
\begin{enumerate}
\item  
The probability of drawing a king of red colour 
\begin{align}
\pr{Y = 0, Z=11} &= \pr{Y = 0}\pr{ Z=11}
\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\times \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{23}
\end{align}


\item  
The probability of drawing a face card is 
\begin{align}
\pr{8\le Z \le 11} =  \frac{12}{52}= \frac{3}{13}
\end{align}


\item  The probability of drawing a red face card from the deck is 

\begin{multline}
\pr{Y=0,8\le Z \le 11 }
\\
=\pr{Y=0}\pr{8\le Z \le 11 }
\\
=\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{3}{13}= \frac{3}{23}
\end{multline}


\item The probability of drawing a jack of hearts is 
\begin{align}
\pr{Z = 9, X = 0} = \frac{1}{13}\times \frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{52}
\end{align}


\item The probability of drawing a spade is 

\begin{align}
\pr{X = 1}= \frac{13}{52}= \frac{1}{4}
\end{align}


\item 	The probability of drawing a queen of diamond is 

\begin{align}
\pr{X = 2, Z = 10} &= \pr{X = 2}\pr{ Z = 10} 
\\
&=\frac{1}{4}\times \frac{1}{13} = \frac{1}{52}
\end{align}
