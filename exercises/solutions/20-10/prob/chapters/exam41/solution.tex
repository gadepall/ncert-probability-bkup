Let X be the random variable denoting the number of times head is obtained when a coin is tossed n times. Then by Binomial distribution,
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 1} &= p
\\
\pr{X = k} &= \comb{n}{k} p^k \brak{1-p}^{n-k}
\\
k = 0,\dots, n
\label{eq:exam41_1}
\end{align}
For the given problem, $n = 10$ and $p = 1-p = \frac{1}{2}$ for a fair coin
\begin{enumerate}
\item From \eqref{eq:exam41_1},
\begin{align}
\pr{X = 6}= \comb{10}{6}\brak{\frac{1}{2}}^{10}
= \frac{105}{512}
\label{eq:exam41_2}
\end{align}
\item Similarly, 
\begin{align} 
\pr{X \geq 6}&=\sum_{k=6}^{10}\pr{X=k}
\\
&=\sum_{k=6}^{10}\comb{10}{k}\brak{\frac{1}{2}}^{10}
\\
&= \frac{193}{512}
\label{eq:exam41_3}
\end{align}
\item 
\begin{align}
\pr{X \leq 6}&= 1 - \pr{X \geq 6} + \pr{X=6}
\\
&= 1 - \frac{193}{512} +  \frac{105}{512} 
\\
&=\frac{53}{64}
\end{align}
upon substituting \eqref{eq:exam41_2} and \eqref{eq:exam41_2}, 
\end{enumerate}
The python code for the above problem is,

\end{lstlisting}
Experimental probability is calculated using the number of heads obtained in each of the 1,000,000 random experiments of tossing of 10 coins.
The code compares the experimental probability to the theoretical probability. As number of experiments increase, the experimental probability approaches the theoritical probability.
