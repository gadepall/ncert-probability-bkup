Total number of marbles = 3 + 5 = 8 marbles\\
Let $X \in \{0,1\}$ represent the random variable, where 0 represents a red marble, 1 represents a black marble. From the given information, 

\begin{enumerate}
    
\item Probability that the ball taken out will be red = \pr{X=0}
\begin{align}
    \pr{X=0} &= \frac{\text{number of red balls}}{\text{total number of balls}}\\
    \pr{X=0} &= \frac{3}{8} = 0.375
\end{align}
\item Probability that the marble taken out will not be red = \pr{X = 1}\\
Because the complementary of \pr{X=0} is \pr{X=1}\\
We know that the sum of probabilities of every random variable is 1. So,
\begin{align}
    \pr{X = 1}+\pr{X=0}=1
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \implies \pr{X = 1} &= 1 -\pr{X=0} \\
    &= 1-0.375 \\
    &= 0.625
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \implies \pr{X = 1} = 1 - 0.375 = 0.625
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
