Total number of faces in a die = 6
\\Let $X \in \{0,1,2\}$ represent the random variable, where $X$ being 0 represents faces of die in which 1 is written, 1 represents faces of die in which 2 is written, and 2 represents face of die in which 5 is written. \\From the given information, 
\begin{enumerate}
    
\item Probability that faces of die in which 1 is written is obtained = Pr(X=0)
\begin{align}
    Pr(X=0) = \frac{\text{Number of faces with 1}}{\text{Total number of faces}}\\
    Pr(X=0) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\end{align}
\item Probability that faces of die in which 2 is written is obtained = Pr(X=1)
\begin{align}
    Pr(X=1) = \frac{\text{Number of faces with 2}}{\text{Total number of faces}}\\
    Pr(X=1) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}
\end{align}
\item Probability that faces of die in which 5 is written is obtained = Pr(X=2)
\begin{align}
    Pr(X=2) = \frac{\text{Number of faces with 5}}{\text{Total number of faces}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    Pr(X=2) = \frac{1}{6} = 0.1\overline{6}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}

The mean of the numbers obtained on throwing
a die = Expected value on face of die
\begin{align}
E(X) = \sum_{i = 0}^{2} Pr(X=i) \times x_{i}
\end{align}
where: $Pr(X=i)$ represents the probability that X=i and $x_{i}$ represents value obtained in face of the die when X=i 
\begin{align}
= \dfrac{1}{2} \times 1 + \dfrac{1}{3} \times 2 + \dfrac{1}{6} \times 5 = 2
\end{align}
