Let $\textbf{X} \in \{0,1\}$ be a random variable where 0 represents a diamond card getting lost and 1 reperesent  a card which is not a diamond becoming lost. \\
Let $\textbf{Y} \in \{0,1\} $ be a random variable where 0 represents both cards drawn being diamonds and 1 represents the case where atleast 1 of the 2 cards drawn is not a diamond.\\
The required probability is pr(X=0$|$Y=0).\\
\\Since there are 13 diamond cards,
\begin{align}
    \pr{X=0}=\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}\\
    \pr{X=1}=\frac{39}{52}=\frac{3}{4}
\end{align}
$(X=0 \cap Y=0)$ is the event of a diamond card getting lost and getting 2 diamond cards in the 2 draws.\\
Hence,
\begin{align}
    \pr{X=0 \cap Y=0}=\frac{\comb{13}{3}}{\comb{52}{3}}
\end{align}
Using Total probability theorem,
\begin{align}
    \pr{F}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\pr{F \vert E_{i}}\pr{E_{i}} \label{5.16:eq1}
\end{align}
$\pr{Y=0|X=0}$ is probability of selecting 2 diamond cards given that one diamond card is lost.
\begin{align}
   \implies \pr{Y=0 \vert X=0}=\frac{\comb{12}{2}}{\comb{51}{2}}
\end{align}
$\pr{Y=0|X=1}$ is probability of selecting 2 diamond cards given that the card lost is not a diamond.
\begin{align}
    \implies \pr{Y=0 \vert X=1}=\frac{\comb{13}{2}}{\comb{51}{2}}
\end{align}
%by using equation \eqref{5:16:eq1},
Thus,
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    \pr{Y=0}=\frac{\comb{12}{2}}{\comb{51}{2}}+\frac{\comb{13}{2}}{\comb{51}{2}}
\end{split}
\end{align}
by definition,
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    \pr{X=0 \vert Y=0}&=\frac{\pr{X=0 \cap Y=0}}{\pr{Y=0}}\\\\
                     &=\frac{11}{50}\\\\
                     &=0.22
\end{split}
\end{align}
