Let the Bernoulli random variable $X = \{ 0,1 \}$ denote the outcome of the given experiment.\\
$X = 0$ denotes the outcome that Savita and Hamida have their birthdays on a \textit{same day} of the year.\\
$X = 1$ denotes the outcome that Savita and Hamida have their birthdays on \textit{different days} of the year.
\begin{align}
    \pr{X = 0} &= \frac{1}{365} \label{eqn:2.0.1}\\
    \therefore \pr{X = 0} &= 0.00273972\\
    \because \pr{X = 0} + \pr{X = 1} &= 1 \\
    \therefore \pr{X = 1} &= 1 - \pr{X = 0}\label{eqn:2.0.3}
\end{align}\\
Putting the value of $\pr{X = 0}$ from \eqref{eqn:2.0.1} in \eqref{eqn:2.0.3}
\begin{align}
     \pr{X=1} &= 1 - \frac{1}{365}\\
     \pr{X = 1} &= \frac{364}{365}\\
    \therefore \pr{X = 1} &= 0.99726027
\end{align}
