From the given information, 
	\begin{align}
	\pr{E F} &= \pr{E}  \pr{F} 
\label{eq:2.1.23_ind}
	\end{align}
Then,
	\begin{align}		
	\pr{E F'} &= \pr{E\brak{1-F}} = \pr{E -EF}
\\
&=\pr{E}  - \pr{E\cap F} 
\\
&= \pr{E}-\pr{E}\pr{F}
\\
&=\pr{E} \brak{1 - \pr{F} }\\
 &= \pr{E} \pr{1-F}
\\
 &= \pr{E} \pr{F'}
	\end{align}
	$\therefore E$ and $F'$ are independent events.

	\solution The area is given as
	\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{2}\norm{\myvec{3\\1\\4}\times\myvec{1\\-1\\1}}
	\end{align}
	which is calculated and found as 3.24
