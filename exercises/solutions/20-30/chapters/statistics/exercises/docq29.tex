	  See Table 	\ref{table:stat_ex_q29_quetable6}.
Since the minimum =2 and maximum = 32, we take the intervals as 0-5,5-10 and so on upto 30-35. It can be observed that there are very few engineers whose homes are at more than or equal to 20km distance from their work place and most engineers have their workplace at distance of 0km to 15km from their homes.
