	\item Assume that each born child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl. If a family has two children, what is the conditional probability that both are girls given that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the youngest is a girl,
		\item at least one is a girl?
	\end{itemize}
	\solution We need to find the probability that both the children are girls, given that the youngest is a girl.
	Let F denote the event 'youngest child is a girl' and E denote the event 'Both children are girls'. We need to find $P\brak{\frac{E}{F}}$.\\
	
	The possibilities satisfying event E are 	
\begin{align}
	\myvec{\bmat{g&g}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	P\brak{E} = \frac{1}{4}
\end{align}	
	The possibilities satisfying event F are 	
\begin{align}
	\myvec{\bmat{g&g},\bmat{b&g}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	P\brak{F} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\\	
	Also E\cap F = \myvec{\bmat{g&g}}\\
	P\brak{E\cap F} = \frac{1}{4}\\
	P\brak{\frac{E}{F}} = \frac{P\brak{E\cap F}}{P\brak{F}}\\
	P\brak{\frac{E}{F}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}

		\item The matrix $A_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}|-3i+j|$ obtained is
		\begin{align}
			\myvec{0&0.5&1&1.5\\1.5&1&0.5&0\\3&2.5&2&1.5}
		\end{align}
		\item The matrix $A_{ij} = 2i-j$ obtained is
		\begin{align}
			\myvec{0&-1&-2&-3\\2&1&0&-1\\4&3&2&1}
