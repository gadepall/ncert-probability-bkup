\item Two cards are drawn at random and without replacement from a pack of 52 playing cards. Find the probability that both the cards are black.\\
\solution Let the event A be ”first card is black" and B the event ”second card is black if first card is black". Let E be the event "both the cards are black".\\
Since there are 26 black cards in a pack of 52 cards,
\begin{align}
P\brak{A} &= \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} 
\end{align}
If the first card drawn is black 51 cards remain out of which 25 are black cards.
\begin{align}
P\brak{B} &= \frac{25}{51}\\
\therefore P\brak{E} &= P\brak{A}.P\brak{B}\\
P\brak{E} &= \frac{25}{51}\times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{25}{102}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
