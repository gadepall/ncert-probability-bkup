\item Suppose that the reliability of a HIV test is specified as follows: Of people having HIV, 90\% of the test detect the disease but 10\% go undetected. Of people free of HIV, 99\% of the test are judged HIV â€“ve but 1\% are diagnosed as showing HIV +ve. From a large population of which only 0.1\% have HIV, one person is selected at random, given the HIV test, and the pathologist reports him/her
as HIV +ve. What is the probability that the person actually has HIV?
\\
	\solution Let E and G denote the events that 'the selected person has HIV' and the 'test judges HIV +ve'. We need to find the probability that the person selected has HIV, if the test judges HIV +ve.i.e $P\brak{\frac{E}{G}}$.
	
\begin{align}
P\brak{E} = 0.001\\
P\brak{E'} = 1 -P\brak{E}\\
P\brak{E'} = 0.999
\end{align}

\begin{align}
P\brak{\frac{G}{E}} &= P\brak{\text{Test judges +ve if person has HIV}}\\
P\brak{\frac{G}{E}} &= 0.9
\end{align}


\begin{align}
P\brak{\frac{G}{E'}} &= P\brak{\text{Test judges +ve if person doesn't have HIV}}\\
P\brak{\frac{G}{E'}} &= 0.01
\end{align}

	\begin{align}
P\brak{\frac{E}{G}} &= \frac{P\brak{E}.P\brak{\frac{G}{E}}}{P\brak{E}.P\brak{\frac{G}{E}} + P\brak{E'}.P\brak{\frac{G}{E'}}}\\
P\brak{\frac{E}{G}} &= \frac{(0.001)(0.9)}{(0.001)(0.9) + (0.999)(0.01)}\\
	\end{align}
	which is calculated to be 0.083

	which is found as ${\myvec{0.25\\-0.43}}$ 
	Representing using matrices we get,\\
	\begin{align}
		\frac{-16}{\myvec{1\\\sqrt{3}}} &= \frac{-16}{\myvec{1&-\sqrt{3}\\\sqrt{3}&1}}
	\end{align}
Multiplying and dividing by the multiplicative inverse,\\
	\begin{align}
		\frac{-16}{\myvec{1\\\sqrt{3}}} &= \frac{-16\myvec{0.25&0.43\\ -0.43&0.25}}{\myvec{1&-\sqrt{3}\\ \sqrt{3}&1}\myvec{0.25&0.43\\-0.43&0.25}}
	\end{align}
	\begin{align}
		\frac{-16}{\myvec{1\\\sqrt{3}}} &= \frac{-16\myvec{0.25&0.43\\-0.43&0.25}}{\myvec{1&0\\ 0&1}}\\
		\frac{-16}{\myvec{1\\\sqrt{3}}} &= \myvec{-4&-6.88\\6.88&-4}\\
		\frac{-16}{\myvec{1\\\sqrt{3}}} &= \myvec{-4\\4\sqrt{3}}
	\end{align}
