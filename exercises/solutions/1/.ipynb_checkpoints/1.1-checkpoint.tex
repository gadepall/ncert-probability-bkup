 Let the random variable $X = \{ 0,1 \}$ denote the outcome of the given experiment.
\\$X = 1$ if the marble picked turns out $Green$.
\\$X = 0$ if the marble picked turns out $Blue$.
\\It is given that,
\begin{align}
P(X = 1) &= \frac{2}{3}\\
\implies P(X = 0) &= 1 - P(X = 1)\\
\implies P(X = 0) &= 1 - \frac{2}{3}\\
\implies P(X = 0) &= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
Now
\begin{align}
n(X = 0) + n(X = 1) &= 24\\
\because P(X = 0) &= \frac{n(X = 0)}{n(X = 0) + n(X = 1)},\\
 n(X = 0) &= P(X = 0)\left(n(X = 0) + n(X = 1)\right)\\
\implies n(X = 0) &= \frac{(1)\times (24)}{3}\\
\implies n(X = 0) &= 8
\end{align}
$\therefore{}$ the  number of blue balls is 8.
