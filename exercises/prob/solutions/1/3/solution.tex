Let $X_i \in \cbrak{0,1}$ represent the $ith$ hurdle where $1$ denotes a hurdle being knocked down and let
\begin{align}
X = \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i
\end{align}
%
where $n$ is the total number of hurdles.
Then $X$ has a binomial distribution with
%
\begin{align}
\pr{X = k} = \comb{n}{k}p^{n-k}\brak{1-p}^k
\end{align}
%
where 
\begin{align}
p &= \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6}
\\
n &= 10
\end{align}
from the given information.  Then,
\begin {align}
\pr{X < 2} = \pr{X = 0} + \pr{X=1}
\\
= \comb{10}{0}\brak{\frac{5}{6}}^{10}\brak{\frac{1}{6}}^0+ 
 \comb{10}{1}\brak{\frac{5}{6}}^{9}\brak{\frac{1}{6}}^1 
\\
=\brak{\frac{5}{6}}^{9}\cbrak{\frac{5}{6}+\frac{10}{6}}
\\
=3\brak{\frac{5}{6}}^{10}
\end{align}
%
which is the desired probability.
