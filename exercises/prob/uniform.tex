\item Two dice, one blue and one grey, are thrown at the same time.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Complete Table \ref{table:1.2.133}.
\item  A student argues that there are 11 possible outcomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Therefore, each of them has a probability $\frac{1}{11}$. Do you agree with this argument? Justify your answer.

\item In a game, a man wins a rupee for a six and loses a rupee for any other number when a fair die is thrown. The man decided to throw a die thrice but to quit as and when he gets a six. Find the expected value of the amount he wins / loses.\\
\item A die is thrown again and again until three sixes are obtained. Find the probability of obtaining the third six in the sixth throw of the die.\\
\item Find the probability of getting 5 exactly twice in 7 throws of a die.\\

\item Find the probability of throwing at most 2 sixes in 6 throws of a single die.\\
\item A bag consists of 10 balls each marked with one of the digits 0 to 9. If four balls are drawn successively with replacement from the bag, what is the probability that none is marked with the digit 0?\\
\item A die is thrown 6 times. If ‘getting an odd number’ is a success, what is the probability of\\
(i) 5 successes?\\
(ii) at least 5 successes?\\
(iii) at most 5 successes?\\
\item Let X denote the sum of the numbers obtained when two fair dice are rolled. Find the variance and standard deviation of X.\\
\item Two numbers are selected at random (without replacement) from the first six positive integers. Let X denote the larger of the two numbers obtained. Find E(X).\\
\item Two dice are thrown simultaneously. If X denotes the number of sixes, find the
expectation of X.\\
\item Determine P(E/F), if a die is thrown three times,\\
E : 4 appears on the third toss, F : 6 and 5 appears respectively on first two tosses\\

\item In a musical chair game, the person playing the music has been
advised to stop playing the music at any time within 2 minutes after she starts playing.What is the probability that the music will stop within the first half-minute after starting?

\item A missing helicopter is reported to have crashed somewhere in the rectangular region shown in Fig. 15.2. What is the probability that it crashed inside the
