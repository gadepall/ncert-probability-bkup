\item How many times must a man toss a fair coin so that the probability of having at least one head is more than 90$\%$?\\
\item An experiment succeeds twice as often as it fails. Find the probability that in the next six trials, there will be at least 4 successes.\\
\item Suppose X has a binomial distribution . Show that X = 3 is the most likely outcome.\\
(Hint : P(X = 3) is the maximum among all P($x_i$), $x_i$= 0,1,2,3,4,5,6)\\
\item The probability that a bulb produced by a factory will fuse after 150 days of use
is 0.05. Find the probability that out of 5 such bulbs\\
(i) none\\
(ii) not more than one\\
(iii) more than one\\
(iv) at least one\\
will fuse after 150 days of use.\\
\item Find the mean number of heads in three tosses of a fair coin.\\

\item Find the probability distribution of\\
(i) number of heads in two tosses of a coin.\\
(ii) number of tails in the simultaneous tosses of three coins.\\
(iii) number of heads in four tosses of a coin.\\
\item Let X represent the difference between the number of heads and the number of tails obtained when a coin is tossed 6 times. What are possible values of X?\\
\item Six balls are drawn successively from an urn containing 7 red and 9 black balls. Tell whether or not the trials of drawing balls are Bernoulli trials when after each draw the ball drawn is\\
(i) replaced \\
(ii) not replaced in the urn.\\

\item If a fair coin is tossed 10 times, find the probability of
\begin{enumerate}
\item  exactly six heads
\item  at least six heads
\item  at most six  heads
\end{enumerate}

\item The probability of a shooter hitting a target is $\frac{3}{4}$. How many minimum
number of times must he/she fire so that the probability of hitting the target at least
once is more than 0.99?

\item Three coins are tossed simultaneously. Consider the event E "three heads or three tails", F "at least two heads" and G "at most two heads". Of the pairs (E,F), (E,G) and (F,G), which are independent? which are dependent?\\

\item A die is tossed thrice. Find the probability of getting an odd number at least once.\\
\\

\item A game consists of tossing a one rupee coin 3 times and noting its outcome each time. Hanif wins if all the tosses give the same result i.e., three heads or three tails, and loses otherwise. Calculate the probability that Hanif will lose the game.
\\

\item A die is thrown twice. What is the probability that\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item  5 will not come up either time? \\
\item  5 will come up at least once?\\
\end{enumerate}
Hint : Throwing a die twice and throwing two dice simultaneously are treated as the
same experiment
