\item It is given that in a group of 3 students, the probability of 2 students not having the
same birthday is 0.992. What is the probability that the 2 students have the same
birthday?
\\
\solution 
We know that two students either have birthday on same date or they don't have same birthday. No other cases are possible.\\
Therefore, we can consider this as a bernoulli distribution, by defining a random variable X such that,if $X=0$, then they don't have same birthday, if $X=1$, then they have same birthday.
Therefore,
\begin{align}
Pr(X=0)+Pr(X=1)=1\\
Pr(X=0)=0.992\\
Pr(X=1)=1-Pr(X=0)\\
Pr(X=0)=1-0.992\\
Pr(X=0)=0.008

\item A box contains 5 red marbles, 8 white marbles and 4 green marbles. One marble is taken
out of the box at random. What is the probability that the marble taken out will be\\
(i) red ?\\
(ii) white ? \\
(iii) not green?
\\
\solution 
Total number of marbles = 5 + 8 + 4 = 17 marbles.
Let $X \in \{0,1,2\}$ represent the random variable, where 0 represents a red marble, 1 represents a white marble, and 2 represents a green marble. From the given information, 
\begin{align}
    Pr(X=0) &= \frac{5}{17} \\
    Pr(X=1) &= \frac{8}{17} \\
    Pr(X=2) &= \frac{4}{17} \implies \pr{X\ne 2} = \frac{13}{17}
