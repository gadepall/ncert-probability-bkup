\item Let E and F be events with $\pr{E} = \frac{3}{5}$, $\pr{F} = \frac{3}{10}$ and  $\pr{E \cap F} = \frac{1}{5}$. Are E and F independent?
\\
\solution 
\begin{align}
\pr{E}\pr{F} = \frac{9}{50} \ne \pr{E \cap F}

\item Events A and B are such that P (A) = $\frac{1}{2}$, P(B) = $\frac{7}{12}$ and P(not A or not B) = $\frac{1}{4}$. State whether A and B are independent ?\\
\solution
\begin{align}
\pr{not\: A \:or\: not\: B} = \pr{A' + B'} 
\end{align}
We know that,\\
\begin{align} \label{6.14:eq:1}
 \pr{A' + B'} = \pr{(AB)'}
\end{align}
As,\\
\begin{align}
(AB)(AB)' = 0 \\
\pr{AB} + \pr{(AB)'} = 1
\end{align}
\begin{align} \label{6.14:eq:2}
\pr{AB} = 1- \pr{(AB)'}
\end{align}
Using ~\ref{6.14:eq:1} in ~\ref{6.14:eq:2}, We get
\begin{align} \label{6.14:eq:3}
\pr{AB} = 1- \pr{A' + B'}
\end{align}
On substituting the value of $\pr{A' + B'}$ in ~\ref{6.14:eq:3}, we get
\begin{align}
\pr{AB} = 1- \frac{1}{4}
\end{align}
\begin{align} \label{6.14:eq:4}
 \implies \pr{AB} = \frac{3}{4}
\end{align}
Given,
$\pr{A} = \frac{1}{2} \:and \:\pr{B} = \frac{7}{12}$
\begin{align} \label{6.14:eq:5}
\implies \pr{A}\pr{B} = \frac{7}{24}
\end{align}
From ~\ref{6.14:eq:4} and ~\ref{6.14:eq:5},
\begin{align}
 \pr{AB}\neq \pr{A}\pr{B}
\end{align}
As the events $A$ and $B$ does not satisfy the definition of independent events,
$\therefore$ Events $A$ and $B$ are dependent.

\item Given that $E$ and $F$ are events such that $\pr{E} = 0.6, \pr{F} = 0.3$ and $\pr{EF} = 0.2$, find $\pr{E|F}$ and $\pr{F|E}$.\\
\solution
By definition, 
\begin{align}
\pr{A|B} = \frac{\pr{AB}}{\pr{B}}
\end{align}
Thus, we can write:
\begin{align}
\pr{E|F} = \frac{\pr{EF}}{\pr{F}} = \frac{0.2}{0.3} = \frac{2}{3}
\end{align}
In a similar manner:
\begin{align}
\pr{F|E} = \frac{\pr{EF}}{\pr{E}} = \frac{0.2}{0.6} = \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}

\item Compute P(A/B), if P(B) = 0.5 and P (A $\cap$ B) = 0.32.\\
\solution
For two events A and B, by definition,
\begin{align}
\pr{A|B} = \frac{\pr{AB}}{\pr{B}}
\end{align}
Given $\pr{B} = 0.5$ and $\pr{AB} = 0.32$
\begin{align}
\pr{A | B} = \frac{0.32}{0.5}
\end{align}
Thus,
\begin{align}
\pr{A | B} = 0.64

\solution
By definition,
\begin{align}
\Pr\brak{A/B} = \frac{\Pr\brak{AB}}{\Pr\brak{B}}
\end{align}
Substituting the values,
\begin{align}
\frac{2}{5} = \frac{\Pr\brak{AB}}{5/13}\\
 \Pr\brak{AB} = \frac{2}{13}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\Pr\brak{A+B} = \Pr\brak{A} + \Pr\brak{B} - \Pr\brak{AB}
\end{align}
Substituting the values,
\begin{align}
\Pr\brak{A+B} = \frac{5}{26} + \frac{5}{13} - \frac{2}{13} = \frac{11}{26}
