\item A pair of dice is thrown 4 times. If getting a doublet is considered a success, find the probability of two successes.\\
\item There are three coins. One is a two headed coin (having head on both faces), another is a biased coin that comes up heads 75$\%$ of the time and third is an unbiased coin. One of the three coins is chosen at random and tossed, it shows heads, what is the probability that it was the two headed coin ?\\

\item A fair coin and an unbiased die are tossed. Let A be the event ‘head appears on
the coin’ and B be the event ‘3 on the die’. Check whether A and B are independent events or not.\\\item An insurance company selected 2000 drivers at random (i.e., without
any preference of one driver over another) in a particular city to find a relationship between age and accidents. The data obtained are given in the Table \ref{table:prob_exam8}.
Find the probabilities of the following events for a driver chosen at random from the city:\\
(i) being 18-29 years of age \textit{and} having exactly 3 accidents in one year.\\
(ii) being 30-50 years of age \textit{and} having one or more accidents in a year.\\
(iii) having no accidents in one year.\\

\item A black and a red dice are rolled.\\
(a) Find the conditional probability of obtaining a sum greater than 9, given that the black die resulted in a 5.\\
(b) Find the conditional probability of obtaining the sum 8, given that the red die resulted in a number less than 4.\\
