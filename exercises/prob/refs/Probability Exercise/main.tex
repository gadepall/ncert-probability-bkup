look at a pen and tell whether or not it is defective. One pen is taken out at random from
this lot. Determine the probability that the pen taken out is a good one.
\item (i) A lot of 20 bulbs contain 4 defective ones. One bulb is drawn at random from the lot.
What is the probability that this bulb is defective?\\
(ii) Suppose the bulb drawn in (i) is not defective and is not replaced. Now one bulb
is drawn at random from the rest. What is the probability that this bulb is not
defective ?
\item A box contains 90 discs which are numbered from 1 to 90. If one disc is drawn at random
from the box, find the probability that it bears (i) a two-digit number (ii) a perfect
square number (iii) a number divisible by 5.
\item A child has a die whose six faces show the letters as given below:\\
\begin{tikzpicture}[outer sep=0.05cm,node distance=0.8cm,]
\tikzstyle{bigbox} = [draw=white!50, thick, fill=white!10, rounded corners, rectangle]
\tikzstyle{box} = [minimum size=0.6cm, rounded corners,rectangle, fill=blue!50]
%
\node[box] (11) {A};
\node[box,right of=11] (12) {B};
\node[box,right of=12] (13) {C};
\node[box,below of=11] (21) {D};
\node[box,right of=21] (22) {E};
\node[box,right of=22] (23) {A};
%
\begin{pgfonlayer}{background}
  \node[bigbox] [fit = (11) (23)] {};
\end{pgfonlayer}
%

(i) She will buy it ?\\

(ii) A student argues that ‘there are 11 possible outcomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.Therefore,each of them has a probability $\frac{1}{11}$ Do you agree with this argument? Justify your answer.
\item A game consists of tossing a one rupee coin 3 times and noting its outcome each time. Hanif wins if all the tosses give the same result i.e., three heads or three tails, and loses otherwise. Calculate the probability that Hanif will lose the game.
\item A die is thrown twice. What is the probability that\\
(i) 5 will not come up either time? \\
(ii) 5 will come up at least once?\\
Hint : Throwing a die twice and throwing two dice simultaneously are treated as the
same experiment
\item Which of the following arguments are correct and which are not correct? Give reasons
for your answer.\\
(i) If two coins are tossed simultaneously there are three possible outcomes—two
heads, two tails or one of each. Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the
probability is $\frac{1}{3}$ \\
(ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes—an odd number or an even
number. Therefore, the probability of getting an odd number is $\frac{1}{2}$\\\\

(ii) consecutive days?\\
(iii) different days?
\item A die is numbered in such a way that its faces show the numbers 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6. It is thrown two times and the total score in two throws is noted. Complete the following
table which gives a few values of the total score on the two throws:
\includegraphics{rows.JPG}\\
What is the probability that the total score is
(i) even? (ii) 6? (iii) at least 6?
\item A bag contains 5 red balls and some blue balls. If the probability of drawing a blue ball is double that of a red ball, determine the number of blue balls in the bag.
\item A box contains 12 balls out of which x are black. If one ball is drawn at random from the box,what is the probability that it will be a black ball?\\
If 6 more black balls are put in the box, the probability of drawing a black ball is now double of what it was before. Find x.
\item A jar contains 24 marbles, some are green and others are blue. If a marble is drawn at random from the jar, the probability that it is green is $\frac{2}{3}$⋅ Find the number of blue balls in the jar.
